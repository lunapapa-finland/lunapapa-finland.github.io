# ðŸŒŸ A Chronicle of Triumph, Wisdom, and Self-Rediscovery

Time, that elusive force, intricately weaves the fabric of our existence, narrating a story of change and transformation. A decade ago, I set sail on a professional odysseyâ€”a fervent young spirit with dreams of conquering the world. The ensuing years unfolded with diverse industries and roles, creating a canvas adorned with moments of triumph and challenges that tested the bounds of my resilience.

[In the hallowed halls of Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.veed.io/view/4c8c61e7-f96c-4528-a096-e1d4bdeeafdb?panel=share), I stood as a symbol of academic prowess, securing the top position and delivering a valedictory speech upon receiving my first master's degree. As an industrial consulting manager for [LCIG](https://www.lenovo.com/ao/en/about/our-businesses/capital-incubator-group), I mastered the art of [crafting value propositions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vGg6SzRDbQ9VtSynKkOvhTSoZBD7chKt/view?pli=1). And, as a co-founder of a startup, I led a team through the highs of success and the lows of entrepreneurial tribulations.

Yet, the relentless march of time ushered in unforeseen challenges, and the disruptive force of [COVID-19](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) altered the trajectory of my narrative. Financial setbacks besieged my startup, compounded by global mobility restrictions that left me stranded and questioning my path. Undoubtedly, setbacks became a chapter, a thorough examination of my resilience. I stumbled, faced the stark reality of failure, and amidst this tempest of uncertainty, my newborn daughter [Luna](/people/) emerged as a guiding lightâ€”an anchor grounding me amidst the tumult.

The dawn of 2023 signaled a turning point as I embraced a new opportunity with [EDISS](https://www.master-ediss.eu/) in Finland. Years away from the industry cast shadows of self-doubt, clouding my confidence and questioning my ability to navigate academic challenges. Yet, after six months of unwavering effort, confidence resurfaced. Today, I proudly declare that the flame of wisdom burns within meâ€”an unwavering beacon.

Reflecting on this odyssey, I celebrate achievements that validate resilience and determination:

1. Attaining excellence with 5 credits in each registered courseâ€”spanning [GPU](https://github.com/lunapapa-finland/EDISS-GPU), [Data Science](https://github.com/lunapapa-finland/EDISS-DS-MINI3), [Parallel Programming](https://github.com/lunapapa-finland/EDISS-PARALLEL), and Artificial Intelligence, among others.

2. Securing a part-time research assistant role, passionately contributing to a groundbreaking maritime robotics project.

3. Crafting a [personal portfolio site](https://lunapapa-finland.github.io/) and revamping my resume, narrating a journey of growth and adaptability.

Standing at this juncture, optimism guides my gaze towards 2024. Goals include securing a summer internship, participating in hackathons, expanding networks, and mastering the Finnish language. Each endeavor marks a stride toward a brighter futureâ€”an envisioned certainty.

In the enduring glow of age, the flame of wisdom within me guides the journey, forevermore. Life's seas may be unpredictable, yet with each undulating wave, I navigate toward a future illuminated by resilience, wisdom, and an unwavering beliefâ€”the best is yet to come. ðŸŒŠâœ¨
