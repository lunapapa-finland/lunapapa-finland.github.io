When **Luna** reached the age of around two, I brought her back to the **Philippines** for a brief period to attend nursery school. A captivating moment captured in a photograph unfolded in a Lego shop, a place she adored with immense delight. Luna's visit to the Lego shop was a testament to her vibrant imagination, a quality she possesses in abundance.

*Her* time in the **Philippines** not only exposed her to the rich cultural experiences but also became a canvas for her rapid learning abilities. It was a joy to witness her soak up knowledge with remarkable speed, a testament to her insatiable curiosity and eagerness to explore the world around her.
