**Luna** graced our lives in the early months of 2021, bringing with *her* the pure joy of new beginnings. A delightful girl, *she* made *her* entrance at [St. Luke's Hospital](https://www.stlukes.com.ph/), and within just five hours, *she* was peacefully asleep, adorned with a radiant smileâ€”a moment beautifully captured in a photograph.

*Her* beauty and serene smile never fail to bring a profound sense of calm to my heart. As a father, the indescribable feeling of parenthood envelops me, and I am dedicated to protecting and cherishing *her* throughout my life.
