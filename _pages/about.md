I am [Ali Kaya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-kaya-finland/), a committed Erasmus Mundus student presently enrolled in the [EDISS program](https://www.master-ediss.eu/) at [Abo Akademi University](https://www.abo.fi/en/). Alongside my studies, I have the privilege of serving as a part-time research assistant in a maritime robotics program, working under the esteemed supervision of [Sebastien Lafond](https://research.abo.fi/en/persons/sebastien-lafond) since Oct. 2023. Additionally, I have been appointed as a research assistant for the summer of 2024 at FNT within Ã…bo Akademi University, working on the [AIDOaRT](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101007350) project.

My academic journey has seen me successfully complete my initial master's degree in Information Technology with distinction from [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/comp/) in 2013. Following this achievement, I entered the corporate landscape, contributing my expertise to renowned multinational corporations. Key roles include serving as a [CoE](https://support.sap.com/en/offerings-programs/ccoe.html) and Field consultant at [SAP](https://www.sap.com/), from 2013 to 2016, followed by assuming the responsibilities of an industrial consulting manager at [Lenovo](https://www.lenovo.com/ao/en/about/our-businesses/capital-incubator-group) from 2016 to 2018. By the close of 2018, I co-founded an e-commerce startup in the Philippines. From 2021 onward, my focus shifted to the significant role of raising my daughter [Luna](/people/), who is now two years old.

Recently, I made the decision to re-enter academia. Since the autumn of 2023, I have been diligently pursuing my second master's degree in [EDISS program](https://www.master-ediss.eu/). Concurrently, I am actively exploring avenues to transition **DIRECTLY** into a doctoral program.

With over a decade of professional experience, my expertise spans [Business Management](#), [IT](#), and [Data consulting](#). I possess extensive knowledge in SAP product domains, covering areas such as [Product Lifecycle Management](https://www.sap.com/products/scm/plm-r-d-engineering.html), [Product Planning](https://www.sap.com/products/erp.html), [Manufacturing Execution](https://www.sap.com/finland/products/scm/execution-mes/what-is-mes.html), and [Master Data Management](https://www.sap.com/finland/products/technology-platform/master-data-governance/what-is-mdm.html). Moreover, I am proficient in guiding projects from conceptualization to implementation, particularly within the realm of [Industry 4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution#:~:text=Industry%204.0%20integrates%20processes%20vertically,all%20key%20value%20chain%20partners.). In the field of [Data Science](#), I am well-versed in tasks ranging from Exploratory Data Analysis to the implementation of machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques such as CNNs and GANs. Regarding [Robotics](#), I am currently delving into [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/index.html).
