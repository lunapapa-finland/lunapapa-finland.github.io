**Luna** and I reunited in **Japan** during the winter holiday after an extended six-month separation. As a father, this time apart allowed me to witness her remarkable growth and development. Despite a noticeable decline in her English proficiency, Luna demonstrated an impressive expansion of her knowledge in various areas, including ancient poetry, logic, and basic mathematical concepts. Her exceptional ability to memorize and recall information accurately was particularly noteworthy.

During our stay in Japan, we explored numerous captivating locations in **Osaka**, **Kyoto**, **Nara** and **Shirahama**. Our adventures included visits to OSAKA Tennoji Zoo, Osaka Castle, Osaka Tsutenkaku, Osaka Kids Plaza, Kyoto Kiyomizu-dera, Nara Park, Shirahama Beach and Aquarium, as well as Kyoto University, among other places. These experiences created cherished memories, and I am optimistic that Luna will retain these moments as she continues to grow. My hope is that the diverse range of activities and sights we encountered during our time together will contribute to her overall development and serve as a foundation for future learning and appreciation.
