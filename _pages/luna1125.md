It's been a span of two months since I last beheld **Luna** in person. Remarkably, she has undergone rapid growth and assimilated a wealth of knowledge. Presently, she adeptly articulates her emotions with a sophistication beyond her years and exudes kindness towards all. Behold this image: she has been bestowed with a Certificate of Commendation from her kindergarten, radiating an irresistible charm. While her proficiency in English may have experienced a slight setback, it's a trivial concern as her immersion in an environment exclusively English-speaking, upon joining me, will catalyze her swift acquisition of the language. Beyond linguistic prowess, she now exhibits independence in her ability to self-feed and tidily organize her playthings. 

I earnestly yearn for the opportunity for Luna to reside with me indefinitely. Regrettably, my current commitments prevent me from dedicating myself entirely to her holistic development. Gratefully, my wife, **Olivia**, has assumed the responsibility of nurturing her with utmost care. With Olivia's devoted care, I am confident that Luna will continue to flourish and evolve exponentially. See you in summer, both of you. I love you.
