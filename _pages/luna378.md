**Luna** embarked on a new chapter of her life when, at the tender age of one, she, my wife, and I made the journey to Turkey. Our decision was fueled by a desire to escape the challenging grasp of the ongoing pandemic. Born during the throes of Covid-19, Luna experienced the stringent restrictions that clouded our days in South East Asia, compelling her to don a mask whenever we ventured outdoorsâ€”an unsettling norm for such a young soul.

As a concerned father, I couldn't shake the worry about the potential impact on her health. It was then that we collectively chose to find solace in the enchanting landscapes of **Turkey**. The allure of this beautiful country, coupled with the uplifting news of the easing of Covid-19 restrictions at the dawn of 2022, beckoned us toward a fresh beginning. In **Turkey**'s embrace, Luna found not only a picturesque environment but also the freedom from the shackles of pandemic constraints, allowing her to explore the world unburdened by the constant reminder of a mask.
